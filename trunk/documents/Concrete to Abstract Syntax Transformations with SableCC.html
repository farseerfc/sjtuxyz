<p>I'm known to grumble about Java technologies, especially those used 
for enterprise development but I have to grudgingly admit that there are
 some pretty cool Java things out there that don't suffer from 
"enterprise quality".
One example is <a href="http://www.sablecc.org/">SableCC</a>, my top 
choice of parser generator.  I often use SableCC to define the syntax of
 configuration files and other data formats that must be read and/or 
edited by people. It makes for formats that are more human-friendly than
 XML but are still easy to parse and process.</p>

<h3>Why SableCC?</h3>

<p>SableCC has an elegant design that cleanly separates the grammar 
definition from the programming language used to implement the parser, 
meaning you don't have to embed Java code into the grammar.  Instead, 
SableCC creates classes to represent the syntax tree and abstract <a 
href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?VisitorPattern">visitor</a> classes 
that you extend to perform transformations, semantic analysis and other 
processing by walking the tree.</p>

<p>The main drawback of the current release of SableCC, 2.18.3, is that 
the generated classes represent the <em>concrete</em> syntax tree, not 
the <em>abstract</em> syntax tree that you really want to work with.  
Defining the abstract syntax tree and writing transformations from to 
concrete to abstract tree is quite an effort, and then you have to write
 your own visitor classes to process that tree.</p>

<p>The latest beta version of SableCC has a feature that addresses this 
problem: you can define an abstract syntax in the grammar and specify 
how the concrete syntax relates to the abstract syntax.  The generated 
parser translates from the concrete syntax to the abstract syntax as it 
parses and returns you the abstract syntax tree. The generated visitor 
classes all work on the abstract syntax tree so your software is 
shielded from the complexities of the concrete syntax.</p>

<p>Currently this feature has virtually no documentation, so here's a 
short tutorial.  I assume you already have some experience of using 
SableCC.  If not, give it a try; I think it's really good.</p>

<h3>Concrete vs. Abstract Syntax</h3>

<p>What's so great about concrete to abstract syntax transformations?  
Let's use the following grammar of simple arithmetic expressions as an 
example.</p>

<pre class="SableCC">Tokens

add = '+';
sub = '-';
mul = '*';
div = '/';
left_paren = '(';
right_paren = ')';
number = [0-9]+;
whitespace = (' ')+;


Ignored Tokens

whitespace;


Productions

expr = {add} [left]:expr add [right]:factor
     | {sub} [left]:expr sub [right]:factor
     | {factor} factor;

factor= {mul} [left]:factor mul [right]:value
        | {div} [left]:factor div [right]:value
        | {value} value;

value = {number} number
      | {parens} left_paren expr right_paren;
</pre>

<p>Using this grammar to parse the expression "(1 + 2) * 3" produces the
 following concrete syntax tree.</p>

<pre>AFactorExpr
|
+- factor : AMulFactor
   |
   +- left : AValueFactor
   |  |
   |  +- value : AParenValue
   |     |
   |     +- "("
   |     |
   |     +- expr : AAddExpr
   |     |  |
   |     |  +- left : AFactorExpr
   |     |  |  |
   |     |  |  +- factor : AValueFactor
   |     |  |     |
   |     |  |     +- value : ANumberValue "1"
   |     |  |
   |     |  +- "+"
   |     |  |
   |     |  +- right : AValueFactor
   |     |     |
   |     |     +- value : ANumberValue "2"
   |     |
   |     +- ")"
   |
   +- "*"
   |
   +- right : AValueFactor
      |
      +- value : ANumberValue "3"
</pre>

<p>As you can see, the concrete syntax tree is pretty complex.  This 
complication affects code that analyses this tree and couples that code 
to the operator precedence rules defined by the grammar.  One result of 
this coupling is that the analysis code will frequently break when we 
change the language.</p>

<p>Ideally, our code would process the tree below, which represents the 
expressions themselves rather than the particular notation we use to 
represent expressions.</p>

<pre>AMulExpr
 |
 +- left : AAddExpr
 |   |
 |   +- left : ANumberExpr "1"
 |   |
 |   +- right : ANumberExpr "2"
 |
 +- right : ANumberExpr "3"
</pre>

<p>This is the abstract syntax tree of the concrete syntax tree shown 
above. The abstract syntax of our expression language can be also be 
represented as a grammar:</p>

<pre class="SableCC">expr = {add} [left]:expr [right]:expr
     | {sub} [left]:expr [right]:expr
     | {mul} [left]:expr [right]:expr
     | {div} [left]:expr [right]:expr
     | {number} number;
</pre>

<p>If only we could tell the parser how to translate the concrete syntax
 to this abstract tree...</p>

<p>With SableCC 3 we can!  A SableCC 3 grammar specifies both the 
concrete and abstract syntaxes with the same notation and annotates the 
concrete syntax to define how it is translated to the abstract syntax.</p>

<h3>CST to AST Transformations</h3>

<p>The abstract syntax tree is defined in a new section called "Abstract
 Syntax Tree" that goes after the productions in the grammar file.  Once
 we've defined our abstract syntax tree, we then annotate the concrete 
syntax tree with translations to the abstract syntax tree.</p>

<p>The translation for each concrete production is specified in two 
parts: the concrete production is annotated to specify which abstract 
production it maps to and each alternative of the production is 
annotated to specify how to translate it to an alternative of the 
abstract production.</p>

<p>Starting with the concrete expr production, we want to translate that
 into the abstract expr production we have defined in our "Abstract 
Syntax Tree" section.  To do so, we use the following annotation written
 between curly braces:</p>

<pre class="SableCC">expr <strong class="Highlight">{-&gt; expr}</strong> = ...
</pre>

<div class="Note">
Note that the concrete and abstract grammars have separate namespaces: a
 production in the "Productions" section can have the same name as one 
in the "Abstract Syntax Tree" section. 
</div>

<p>We then need to specify how the alternatives of the concrete expr 
production map to those of the abstract expr production.  We must map 
the concrete add and sub productions to new nodes of the appropriate 
abstract type. Here's what these transformations look like:</p>

<pre class="SableCC">expr {-&gt; expr} = 
    {add} [left]:expr add [right]:factor  <strong class="Highlight">{-&gt; New expr.add(left.expr, right.expr)}</strong>
  | {sub} [left]:expr sub [right]:factor  <strong class="Highlight">{-&gt; New expr.sub(left.expr, right.expr)}</strong>
  ...
</pre>

<p>Again, the transformations are specified in curly braces and preceded
 by an arrow.  New nodes are created with the <tt>New</tt> keyword 
followed by the name of the node of the abstract syntax tree to create 
and its children, if any, as arguments.  The identifier of an abstract 
syntax tree node is the name of the production suffixed with the name of
 the alternative. E.g. "expr.add" identifies the add alternative of the 
expr abstract production, "expr.sub" identifies the sub alternative.</p>

<p>The child nodes passes as arguments have already been transformed to 
abstract syntax by the time they are passed to the new node. You 
identify a transformed node by the name of the child in the concrete 
grammar suffixed by the type that it has been transformed to.  E.g. 
"left.expr" identifies the left subexpression that has been transformed 
to an abstract expr production.</p>

<p>The last alternative of the concrete expr production is expr.factor. 
 This exists in the concrete syntax to define operator precedence and 
doesn't exist in our abstract syntax.  We want to replace it with the 
transformation of it's only subtree, also named factor.</p>

<pre class="SableCC">expr {-&gt; expr} =
    {add} [left]:expr add [right]:factor  {-&gt; New expr.add(left.expr, right.expr)}
  | {sub} [left]:expr sub [right]:factor  {-&gt; New expr.sub(left.expr, right.expr)}
  | {factor} factor                       <strong class="Highlight">{-&gt; factor.expr}</strong>;

factor {-&gt; expr} =
    {mul} [left]:factor mul [right]:value {-&gt; New expr.mul(left.expr, right.expr)}
  | {div} [left]:factor div [right]:value {-&gt; New expr.div(left.expr, right.expr)}
  | {value} value                         {-&gt; value.expr};

value {-&gt; expr} =
    {number} number                       {-&gt; New expr.number(number)}
  | {parens} left_paren expr right_paren  {-&gt; expr.expr};
</pre>

<p>The transformations of the factor and value productions follow the 
same pattern.</p>

<h3>Transforming Lists</h3>

<p>Another common difficulty with SableCC concrete syntax trees is that 
arbitrarily sized lists often have an unwieldy representation in the 
generated Java code.  As an illustration, let's extend the expression 
language to support functions:</p>

<pre>value = {number} number
  | {parens} left_paren expr right_paren
<strong class="Highlight">  | {function} [name]:identifier left_paren [args]:arg_list right_paren;
  
arg_list = 
    {single} [arg]:expr
  | {multiple} [arg]:expr comma [rest]:arg_list;</strong>
</pre>

<p>The concrete definition of argument lists is pretty awkward.  Our 
analyser has to deal with the "single" and "multiple" alternatives and 
follow the "rest" link in the multiple alternative to collect all the 
arguments. It would be much easier to analyse if the argument 
expressions were stored in a collection.</p>

<p>Again, SableCC 3 come to the rescue.  We can transform the concrete 
arg_list into a list of exprs.  In the generated code, this list is 
stored in a standard Java List.</p>

<p>Firstly, we'll need to add a function alternative to our abstract 
syntax:</p>

<pre class="SableCC">expr = {add} [left]:expr [right]:expr
     | {sub} [left]:expr [right]:expr
     | {mul} [left]:expr [right]:expr
     | {div} [left]:expr [right]:expr
     | {number} number
     <strong class="Highlight">| {function} [name]:identifier [args]:expr*</strong>;
</pre>

<p>The "expr*" type indicates a list of zero or more expr clauses.</p>

<p>Now we need to annotate the concrete function syntax with the 
transformation to the abstract syntax:</p>

<pre class="SableCC">value {-&gt; expr} = 
    {number} number                                                     {-&gt; New expr.number(number)}
  | {parens} left_paren expr right_paren                                {-&gt; expr.expr}
  | {constant} [name]:identifier                                        {-&gt; New expr.constant(name)}
  | {function} [name]:identifier left_paren [args]:arg_list right_paren <strong class="Highlight">{-&gt; New expr.function(name,[args.expr])}</strong>;
</pre>

<p>Note the square brackets around the "[args.expr]" argument.  They 
indicate that the "args" clause is translated into a list of exprs, not a
 single expr.</p>

<p>Finally we need to define how the different alternatives of the 
args_list are collected into a single list.</p>

<pre class="SableCC">arg_list <strong class="Highlight">{-&gt; expr*}</strong> = 
    {single} [arg]:expr                         <strong class="Highlight">{-&gt; [arg.expr]}</strong>
  | {multiple} [arg]:expr comma [rest]:arg_list <strong class="Highlight">{-&gt; [arg.expr, rest.expr]}</strong>;
</pre>

<p>The annotation of the arg_list production "{-&gt; expr*}" indicates 
that it is translated to a list of expr elements.  The annotations of 
the "single" and "multiple" alternatives specify how to build that.  The
 single transformation builds a list with one element, the subexpression
 named arg.  The multiple transformation prepends the subexpression 
named arg to the list created by transforming the rest of the arg_list.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>That covers the basics of concrete-to-abstract syntax transformations
 in SableCC 3.  I hope this overview sheds some light on a powerful but 
underdocumented feature. Concrete-to-abstract syntax transformations let
 SableCC shine in an iterative development process.  By working on the 
abstract syntax, analysis code is shielded from changes to concrete 
syntax. You can add to or change the grammar during the project without 
breaking a lot of existing code.  I've found it easy to design a 
language test-first, repeatedly writing unit tests to specify  syntax 
and semantics and then changing the grammar and interpreter to make the 
tests pass.  This has let me play with language design and quickly 
experiment with new language features.</p>

<p>All the source code used in the examples above and IntelliJ project 
files are available in a <a 
href="http://nat.truemesh.com/archives/cst-to-ast.zip">Zip archive</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 28/09/2005:</strong> SableCC 3.0 is now a stable 
release, so you can happily use it in production systems.</p>
